# StudentRegistrationForm
ðŸš€In this repository, I create a student registration form as my activity in my web development subject in 3rd year. Here, I use HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also used appscript here as my data storage using google sheet.


Instructions:
To check if the data inputted was successfully stored in the google sheet. Just open the data collection.txt file and copy the 

link to your browser and see if the data was already stored.
